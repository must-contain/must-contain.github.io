Usage

### Web API

The catch-all way of retrieving content is to perform HTTP calls to our web API directly.
Note that this is *not recommended* if there's a library available for your language.
Libraries are encouraged to implement caching and other conveniencies.

API requests must be performed against the `http://must-contain.herokuapp.com` hostname.  No limits
are placed on requests per second, but we ask you to use the API with responsibility.  Although no
limits are currently in place, we might add a few if we see abuse.

#### `GET /random/{lang}/{num}`

  + `lang`: The ISO code of the languge in which you need the sentences generated.
    We only support English right now, so use `en`.
  + `num`: Number of sentences to retrieve.  Currently unlimited, but please use with
    responsibility.  The amount of sentences that can be retrieved at any one request will never be
    limited below 100, so if you want to be certain that your code always work, use that as a
    maximum.

Phrases are returned fully constructed and ready to use.  A few parameters and an option to get a
detailed version of the sentence might be added in the future.


Inspiration
-----------

The entire generator is inspired by the [@must_contain][] Twitter account, which tweets
periodically these kind of phrases.  Those tweets are obviously hand-crafted, while we generate
most of our sentences on the fly.
